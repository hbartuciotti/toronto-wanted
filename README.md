- Using **Hilt** for **Dependency Injection**.
- Using **Firebase Cloud Messaging** and **DeepLinks** for **Notifications**.
- Using **Retrofit** to fetch data from an **API** I built.

# Observations

Please note that for privacy reasons the API endpoint information is being hidden. Therefore, upon cloning this project, this will not run without:
- Constants.BASE_URL
- google-services.json

This project was made public to hopefully help other fellow developers  as well as to receive feedback and improve my coding skills.
